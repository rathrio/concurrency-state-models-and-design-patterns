IMMEASURABLE HUGE CONGRATS! You achieved 11/10 pts!
 
1a) 1pts Your first and last statement is very similar. Please use more
distinct ones during an exam. :) Your provided URL is kind of random. Doesn't
make much sense when you don't elaborate quite a bit on that. ;)
 
1b) 1pts Perfect!
 
1c) 1pts Nice!
 
1d) 1pts One more time: Nice!
 
 
2) 3.5pts Your calculations are correct, but I found some issues for the two
conceptual implementations. You didn't introduce nested locks for the
changePositionAndDimension() implementation (-0.5pts each as inconsistencies
could potentially occur). You have (optionally) synchronized x(newValue),
width(newValue), and so forth (+0.5pts), but you missed the synchronization on
setRectangle(...).
 
 
3a) 0.5pts Perfect!
 
3b) 1pts Perfect! Furthermore, your decompilation of the provided code is
really outstanding. You really should receive an x2 BONUS for your efforts! :D
 
3c) 1pts Perfect, and yet again, you provided even more interesting hints,
e.g., the reflection API for reference manipulations. That's really worth an x2
BONUS! :D But that's just nasty as hell. Don't use that. EVER! ;) Because it's
still quite interesting, I'll provide you a link, though:

3d) 1pts Perfect! You also provided a solution for the fairness problem: BONUS
x2 for you here, again! :D Please use next time absolute slide numbers (= PDF
page number) and not the relative ones on each slides. Oscar has some confusing
numbering schemes in his slides :)
