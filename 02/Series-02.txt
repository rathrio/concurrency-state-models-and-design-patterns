Exercise 1
----------

a. What states can a Java thread be in?

   - NEW: not yet started
   - RUNNABLE: executing in the JVM
   - BLOCKED: waiting for a monitor lock
   - WAITING: waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular
              action
   - TIMED_WAITING: waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a
                    specified waiting time
   - TERMINATED: when exited

   See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.State.html
   for more details.

b. How can you turn a Java class into a monitor?

   By declaring all methods of that class as being synchronized (e.g. with the
   synchronized method modifier), you turn instances of that class into a
   monitor.

c. What is the Runnable interface good for?

   If you do not want your class to inherit from Thread (because it might
   already inherit from some other class), you can have that class implement
   the Runnable interface. An instance of that class can then be used to
   initialize a thread.

d. Specify an FSP that repeatedly performs hello, but may stop at any time.

   PROCESS = (
       (hello -> STOP)
       |
       (hello -> PROCESS)
   ).


Exercise 2
----------

    public class Singleton {
        private static Singleton instance = null;

        private Singleton() {}

        public static Singleton getInstance() {
            if (instance == null) {
                instance = new Singleton();
            }
            return instance;
        }
    }

a. What happens if the application is multithreaded?

   The "if (instance == null)" check could be performed by multiple threads at
   the same time. As a consequence, multiple threads could evaluate
   "instance == null" to true and thus overwrite already initialized singleton
   instances. This implementation is therefore not thread-safe.

b. How to implement a thread-safe singleton in Java?

   Synchronize "getInstance()", e.g.,:

       public synchronized static Singleton getInstance() {
           ...

c. Suppose there is 1000 requests/second from different threads to this
   Singleton. Does your implementation introduce a bottleneck? If yes, how can you
   improve it?

   Only one thread can now call getInstance() at the time. This makes sense for
   the lazy-initialization behaviour, but we now unnecessarily have threads
   acquire a lock everytime they just want to read the reference to an existing
   instance. This might decrease performance.

   This can be solved by not synchronizing at all: Java internally synchronizes
   the loading of classes. With this knowledge, we can remove the synchronized
   modifier and simply move the initialization of the singleton to another
   class, e.g.,:

       private static class Helper {
           static Singleton instance = new Singleton();
       }

       public class Singleton {
           public static Singleton getInstance() {
               // Only one thread may load the class Helper for the first time,
               // hence guaranteeing that only one thread triggers the creation
               // of a singleton. Subsequent reads require no locking!
               return Helper.instance;
           }
       }


Exercise 3
----------

APPOINTMENT

    APPOINTMENT = (hello -> converse -> goodbye -> STOP).

HOLIDAY

    HOLIDAY = (arrive -> relax -> leave -> HOLIDAY).

SPEED

    SPEED = (on -> ON),
    ON    = (speed -> ON | off -> SPEED).

LEFTONCE

    LEFTONCE = (ahead -> AHEAD),
    AHEAD    = (left -> STOP | right -> LEFTONCE).

TREBLE

    TREBLE = (
        in[1] -> out[3] -> TREBLE
        |
        in[2] -> out[6] -> TREBLE
        |
        in[3] -> out[9] -> TREBLE
    ).

FIVETICK

    FIVETICK = (tick -> tick -> tick -> tick -> tick -> STOP).

FIVETICK, more generically

    const N = 5
    FIVETICK     = TICK[0],
    TICK[n:0..N] = (when (n < N) tick -> TICK[n + 1]).

PERSON

    PERSON = (
        workday -> sleep -> work -> PERSON
        |
        holiday -> sleep -> {play,shop} -> PERSON
    ).


Exercise 4
----------

a. How many states and how many possible traces does it have if the number of
   steps is 5 (as in the lecture)?

   #states = (5 + 1)^2
           = 36

   #traces = 10 choose 5
           = 10! / (5! * (10 - 5)!)
           = 252

b. What is the number of states and traces in the general case (i.e. for n steps)?

   The total possible number of states is simply the product of states, so in
   our case, where both processes have n states:

       #states = (n + 1)^2

   To get the total number of traces you choose a possible trace "without
   putting it back" from the (ordered) pool of steps. This can be computed with
   the binomial coefficient, i.e. (p choose q). In our case, p is the number of
   steps of the two processes added up and q is the number of steps for one
   process.

   p = n + n
   q = n
   #traces = (p choose q)
           = p! / (q! * (p - q)!)

c. Check your solution using the LTSA tool.

   I played around with N in the following FSP from the slides:

       const N = 1         // NOTE: meaning 2 states
       Competitor = KM[0],
       KM[n:0..N] = (when (n<N) [n+1] -> KM[n+1] | when(n == N) done -> STOP).

       ||Race5K = (tortoise:Competitor || hare:Competitor).

   The number of states, for instance, is displayed in the output tab.
