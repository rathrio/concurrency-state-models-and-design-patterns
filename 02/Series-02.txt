Exercise 1

a. What states can a Java thread be in?

   - NEW: not yet started
   - RUNNABLE: executing in the JVM
   - BLOCKED: waiting for a monitor lock
   - WAITING: waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular
              action
   - TIMED_WAITING: waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a
                    specified waiting time
   - TERMINATED: when exited

   See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.State.html
   for more details.

b. How can you turn a Java class into a monitor?

   By declaring all methods of that class as being synchronized (e.g. with the
   synchronized method modifier), you turn instances of that class into a
   monitor.

c. What is the Runnable interface good for?

   If you do not want your class to inherit from Thread (because it might
   already inherit from some other class), you can have that class implement
   the Runnable interface. An instance of that class can then be used to
   initialize a thread.

d. Specify an FSP that repeatedly performs hello, but may stop at any time.

   PROCESS = (
       (hello -> STOP)
       |
       (hello -> PROCESS)
   ).
