Exercise 1
----------

a. What are safety properties? How are they modeled in FSP?

   Safety properties assert that nothing bad happens, e.g., shared data is not
   corrupted when concurrent processes interact with it.

   You can express safety conditions in FSPs as a "property" expression. In
   such an expression, all state transitions that are not explicitly declared
   automatically lead to an ERROR state. See slide 27 of lecture 3 for an
   example.

b. Is the busy-wait mutex protocol fair? Deadlock-free? Justify your answer.

   Yes, it fair and deadlock-free.

   TODO: Justify

c. Can you ensure safety in concurrent programs without using locks?

   Yes, see actor model description in d.

d. The Java language designers decided to implement concurrency based on
   monitors. What is the main reason behind this decision? What other options
   except monitors could have been chosen? (Hint: Consider slide 28 of lecture 1)

   A monitor is an entity that encapsulates resources and operations that
   manipulate them (def on slide 33, lecture 1). This description pretty much
   applies to a Java object as well. Thus it's not that far-fetched to use a
   monitor based concurrency model, whereas the Java objects themselves may act
   as monitors.

   They could have also went with an actor model, where processes only modify
   local state and communicate with others via message passing only,
   eliminating the need for locking shared data access. This is also not that
   far away from the concept of objects sending messages to collaborate.

   See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model for more details.


Exercise 2
----------

Are T1 and T2 equivalent? Why?

    R = (a->c->R).
    S = (b->c->S).
    ||T1 = (R || S).
    T2 = (a->b->c->T2|b->a->c->T2).

Not quite: Unlike in T2, the c in T1 represents an action that has to occur
simultaneously for all traces. This can be verified in the LTS. c in T1 can
only happen from one state. This is not the case for T2.

Exercise 3
----------

    RADIO = (on -> TUNED_TOP),
    TUNED_TOP = (
        off -> RADIO
        |
        reset -> TUNED_TOP
        |
        scan -> SCANNING
    ),
    SCANNING = (
        off -> RADIO
        |
        reset -> TUNED_TOP
        |
        scan -> SCANNING
        |
        lock -> TUNED
        |
        end -> BOTTOM
    ),
    TUNED = (
        off -> RADIO
        |
        reset -> TUNED_TOP
        |
        scan -> SCANNING
    ),
    BOTTOM = (
        off -> RADIO
        |
        reset -> TUNED_TOP
        |
        scan -> BOTTOM
    ).

Note that this FSP doesn't model a "countable" FM band, since the number of
stations is not defined. This radio could tune into an infinite amount of
stations until we reach the BOTTOM state. As a consequence, it doesn't matter
whether the radio is tuned in at the top of the band or somewhere in the
middle.

Given that uncountable nature, we could merge TUNED_TOP with TUNED and get a
smaller FSP that models the same radio:

    RADIO = (on -> TUNED),
    TUNED = (
        off -> RADIO
        |
        reset -> TUNED
        |
        scan -> SCANNING
    ),
    SCANNING = (
        off -> RADIO
        |
        {lock, reset} -> TUNED
        |
        scan -> SCANNING
        |
        end -> BOTTOM
    ),
    BOTTOM = (
        off -> RADIO
        |
        reset -> TUNED
        |
        scan -> BOTTOM
    ).

You can generate the LTS by pasting the FSP in the LTSA tool and clicking on
compile.


Exercise 4
----------

STACK = (
    push[v:0..1] -> pop[v] -> push[w:0..1] -> pop[w] -> STACK
    |
    push[v:0..1] -> push[w:0..1] -> pop[w] -> pop[v] -> STACK
).

LOCK = (acquire -> release -> LOCK).

PRODUCER = (acquire -> push[0..1] -> release -> PRODUCER).
CONSUMER = (acquire -> pop[0..1] -> release -> CONSUMER).

||PC = (LOCK || STACK || PRODUCER || CONSUMER).
