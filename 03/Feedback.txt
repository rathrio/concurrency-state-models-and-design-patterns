HUGE CONGRATS! You achieved 9.5/10 pts!
 
1a) 0.5pts Nice!
 
1b) 0.5pts Nice! Even nicer would have been to say that it's been formally
proven. You were actually the first one mentioning it relies on at least two
processes :)
 
1c) 0.5pts Hmmm, really not the solution we were targeting at, but it's legit.
:) Please still have a look at our proposal.
 
1d) 0.5pts Perfect! (Even though you used the same answer twice (!), quite
impressive work you did here :)
 
 
2) 1pts Correct. You may could have mentioned the key part that manifests as
shared action "c" that provides synchronization in T1 and leads to traces that
can be found in T2.
 
 
3) 2.5pts You could have merged state 3 with state 1 in the minimized state
diagram, because the differentiation between "end" and "other frequency locked"
is insignificant. The really funny thing is, though, that the minimized state
diagrams of both your solutions are identical :D
 
 
4) 4pts You provided a really nice solution based on error states. We like the
solution without any error states better, but nevertheless, your solution is
perfectly fine! Congrats on this one! :D
